THE FINER POINTS OF C :|: STRUCT POINTERS
Corresponding C source: "struct_pointers.c"

Members of pointers to structs are usually accessed as follows:
    foo->bar;
But, as with arrays in #1, this isn't what's actually happening. "->" is a shortcut to:
    (*foo).bar;

When explicitly casting a struct, you can do the same thing:
    ((struct foo *) ptr)->member;
Is equivalent to:
    (*(struct foo *) ptr).member;

See the corresponding source file "struct_pointers.c" for an example.
