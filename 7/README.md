THE FINER POINTS OF C :|: LITTLE-KNOWN OPERATORS
Corresponding C source: "operators.c"

There are some little-known operators in C. Some of these are real.

Some are just silly, and I found them on StackOverflow.

See the C source "operators.c" for some weird operators.

Also, did you know that it's possible to do math in C without using any of the typical math operators? C logical operators are powerful enough that if you manipulate them correctly you can add, subtract, multiply and divide properly, without the characters.

Check out "add-sub.c" for an example of math without +-/*.
